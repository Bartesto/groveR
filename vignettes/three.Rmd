## Purpose
This is where the whole analysis begins. A vegetation index will be converted to 
a cover metric which will make all outputs more meaningful. There will have been 
a lot of work done prior to this stage. Field measures of cover will have been 
regressed with a variety of vegetation indices to find the best relationship. 
That work will have resulted in an index being chosen for the annual data plus 
model coefficients being recorded in the calibration file.

## Calibration file
This csv file holds the model coefficients that when applied to the index rasters, 
will convert them to a measure of cover. It should be located in the 
**Processing Folder** in `supplementary/`. The csv needs to have the following 
format:

Please ensure the column names are as indicated above. The names mean:

**coef** - the model coefficient.

**intercept** - the model intercept.

**multiple** - a multiple to turn the model output to a percentage.

**lower** - a lower limit to apply to the veg density. In this instance we are not 
interested in densities below 10%.

**upper** - an upper limit to apply to the veg density. 

## Use the veg_dens() function
Lets run the function. The following code block uses the data we have set up 
previously. If using your own data change the parameters to suit. Below I assign 
all the parameters to variables and pass those to the function. I find this 
neater and will do this in the remaining vignettes. Alternatively you can input the 
parameters directly to the function.

```{r, veg_dens, eval=FALSE}
# Assign the parameters
irast <- "./index_rasters"
rastkey <- "AA.tif"
choice <- "all"
index <- "ndvi"
ext <- ".tif"
calibration <- "./supplementary/calibration.csv"

# Run the function
veg_dens(irast, rastkey, choice, index, ext, calibration)
```

* **irast** - input index raster file path.
* **rastkey** - wildcard to ensure correct file extension is parsed. 
* **choice** - here we elect to do everything in the folder. When updating products 
you can input one year, e.g. 2006 or a selection e.g. c(2006, 2009). Note years 
can be entered as a numeric.
* **index** - as it appears in the file name. The function will construct a new name 
for the out put and replace this.
* **ext** - output raster format of choice (would recommend .tif).
* **calibration** - calibration csv location.

## What's going to happen?
A new directory will be created, `veg_dens/` and vegetation density rasters will 
be written to it. These will be the inputs for the next function.
