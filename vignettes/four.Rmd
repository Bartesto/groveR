## Purpose
Masking is important in remote sensing analysis as it is used to exclude 
areas not intended for processing. This focuses the analysis and cuts down  
processing times as only what's important is worked on.

The masking that the `groveR` package performs can be thought of as "general" 
masking, where areas common to all image time steps are masked. For example in 
this study, land above the high water level where mangroves don't grow, is 
excluded.

Any masking that affects only specific time steps, such as cloud masking, should 
have been done during image selection and index raster creation. `groveR` does 
not have any functionality in this area. It does however have the ability to encode 
cloud masked areas so that they can be included in statistics. More on this in 
the next vignette.

## Use the mask_product() function
To mask out an area, a raster mask is applied to a raster of interest. Usually a 
mask is generated with 1's and 0's, where 1's indicate the area of interest. When 
the mask is applied, any areas where there is a 0 is excluded.

The alternate scenario is also possible (1 indicates areas to be excluded) and in 
this function that will be called an "inverse" mask. 

The example data includes a land mask and an inverse reef mask and this will be 
applied below. It is important that if your mask is "inverse" then it contains 
'INV' in it's name. For example our reef mask is called "reef_msk_INV.img".

```{r, gen_msk, eval=FALSE}
# Assign the parameters
irast <- "./veg_dens"
rastkey <- ".img"
choice <- "all"
imask <- "./raster_masks"
maskkey <- ".img"

# Run the function
mask_product(irast, rastkey, choice, imask, maskkey)
```

* **irast** - input veg density raster file path.
* **rastkey** - wildcard to ensure correct file extension is parsed. 
* **choice** - here we elect to do everything in the folder. When updating products 
you can input one year, e.g. 2006 or a selection e.g. c(2006, 2009). Note years 
can be entered as a numeric.
* **imask** - input mask raster file path.
* **maskkey** - wildcard to ensure correct file extension is parsed.

## What's going to happen?
A new directory will be created, `veg_dens_mskd_for_trends/` and the masked 
vegetation density rasters will be written to it. These will be the inputs for 
other functions.
