## Purpose
Clouds are the bane of remote sensing studies. They obscure the reflectance values 
of the endmembers we are interested in and if not dealt with will skew results. 
Clouds should have been masked out of the index rasters and depending on the method 
or software, either a shape file or raster mask would have been used.

Null or NA values are left in the place of clouds post masking. In the Mangrove 
Monitoring program at DBCA we encode these places with a value (-99) that 
differentiates it from other masked areas. That way we can report on areas "lost"  
to reporting or classify these areas based on the likelihood they haven't changed 
since the previous time step.


## Use the cloud_mask() functions
In `groveR` there are functions that take the masks used to originally mask out 
cloud (must be raster masks) and redefine those areas with a -99 value. There is 
a "bulk" version that can take a whole directory of raster inputs and apply the 
masks based on year. There is also a "select" version that allows for re-doing or 
updating one or a selection of years.

Cloud raster masks should be stored in `raster_masks/cloud_masks/` and must have 
the year they apply to in their name. See internal data example.

To run the "bulk" version:

```{r, bulk, eval=FALSE}
# Assign the parameters
irast <- "./veg_dens_mskd"
rastkey <- ".tif"
imask <- "./raster_masks/cloud_masks"
maskkey <- ".tif"

# Run the function
cloud_mask_bulk(irast, rastkey, imask, maskkey)
```

* **irast** - file path to input veg density rasters that have been masked "generally".
* **rastkey** - wildcard to ensure correct file extension is parsed. 
* **imask** - file path to input cloud mask rasters.
* **maskkey** - wildcard to ensure correct file extension is parsed.

To run the "select" version:

```{r, select, eval=FALSE}
# Assign the parameters
irast <- "./veg_dens_mskd"
rastkey <- ".tif"
choice <- 2006
imask <- "./raster_masks/cloud_masks"
maskkey <- ".tif"

# Run the function
cloud_mask_select(irast, rastkey, choice, imask, maskkey)
```

The only new parameter is:

* **choice** - numeric representing one or a selection of years e.g. c(2006, 2008)

## What's going to happen?
A new directory will be created, `veg_dens_mskd_for_class/` and the cloud encoded  
vegetation density rasters will be written to it. These will be the inputs for 
other functions.
